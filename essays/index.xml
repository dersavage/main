      <description>This morning I read an article written by a certain developer praising a certain software engineering book. But there were two problems. While the engineer seemed competent enough, and the book famous enough (it&amp;rsquo;s like Shakespeare, everyone claims it&amp;rsquo;s a masteriece but nobody seems to have read or finished it.), the book has serious problems and the engineer was unaware that he was unaware of those problems.
For context, the problems highlighted in that &amp;lsquo;masterpiece&amp;rsquo; book were pinpointed by someone at least in the same league as the authors of the masterpiece (if not better, but I&amp;rsquo;m being conservative here.</description>

      <description>I learned Qur&amp;rsquo;aanic Arabic (as a foreign language&amp;ndash;at the local mosque) when I was eight years old. But then decades had to pass when, after learning a great deal of worldly things, I am now feeling ready to truly study our Noble Book, and while I am brushing up on my classical Arabic, in the meantime, I wanted to find an English translation that was not deviating from the original in any sense.</description>

      <title>Inception: What on earth?</title>

      <description>In this essay, I am going to rant about Inception.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t think I watched it. I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to go beyond 17 minutes (out of 2+ hours). I think 17 minutes is enough to decide whether it is rubbish or not. In my opinion, it is a rubbish of the most interesting sort.
But how can it be? Out of 16000 reviews on Amazon, 95% are five- and four-star.</description>
