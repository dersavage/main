            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I occasionally read Y Combinator&rsquo;s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">&lsquo;Hackernews&rsquo;</a> but each time I do, I&rsquo;m reminded how it resembles Winston&rsquo;s world in the novel <em>1984</em>.</p>
<p>My visits are programming related; I want to know what new developments have been occurring in the programming world. Occasionally it will also serve as a news aggregator in general. To be fair, to this end, it serves a useful niche, and I will continue visiting the site for this purpose.</p>
<p>What I take issue with is the commenting system, which borders on toxic because there is no diversity of opinion, and the &lsquo;upvote&rsquo; system in place discourages any deviations in any other direction than the one the majority of the readers prefer.</p>
<p>Also, while it&rsquo;s understandable that a moderator should control comment quality, the current system employed within HN is ridiculously authoritarian.</p>
<p>In other words, they allow you to write things as long as they are the things they allow you to write. Pick any color as long as it&rsquo;s blue, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>The so-called &lsquo;karma&rsquo; system where your comment gets upvoted or downvoted is already bad enough. If you write &rsquo;language X is better than language Y&rsquo; and the majority of HNers disagree, then your comment gets downvoted all the way to virtual hell.</p>
<p>A system like this generates mindless, mind-numbing &rsquo;everybody-thinks-alike&rsquo; groupthink echochamber that is basically a waste of time for an intelligent reader.</p>
<p>A better method would&rsquo;ve been to assign different colors for agreement and disagreement, so that both types of comments would become popular: green for agreements and red for disagreements and blue for irrelevant.</p>
<p>A variation of this employed in the game review section of Steam. Positive comments are blue upvotes, negative comments are blue downvote, then these reviews themselves are subject to additional meta-review by comment-readers.</p>
<p>Had HNews had employed something similar, you would then have an interesting collection of comments grouped by color and see how the general readership views different topics.</p>
<p>As it is now, if your comment elicits strong disagreement, it will get &lsquo;flagged&rsquo; which means nobody will be able to see or read it. Very 1984.</p>
<p>I rarely if ever comment myself (I prefer writing on my own platform), but I read a lot of comments on HN. This morning, I found some comments that had generated lively discussions, but I could not read the original and very-much-flagged comment because it was rendered invisible.</p>
<p>Such a system also has more insidious effects on the people frequenting the site. It force-teaches intellectual subservience, and kills creativity and originality. In other words, if everybody thinks alike, nobody is really thinking at all.</p>
