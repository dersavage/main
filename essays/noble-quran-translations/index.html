            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I learned Qur&rsquo;aanic Arabic (as a foreign language&ndash;at the local mosque) when I was eight years old. But then decades had to pass when, after learning a great deal of worldly things, I am now feeling ready to truly study our Noble Book, and while I am brushing up on my classical Arabic, in the meantime, I wanted to find an English translation that was not deviating from the original in any sense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the intentions were all good, most of the translations I found were not acceptable. Some had added extra phrases which were not in the original or even implied in any way, others had written the English in such a style that somehow lost the essence.</p>
<p>I wanted an English translation whose style was loyal to the Prestige of the original, even though, of course, the Style cannot be imitated.  I also did not want to read translations by those who had their own agendas (agendas that deviate from true Islam), nor did I want the simplified translations, or ones where the language had been either archaic or &lsquo;modernized&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s asking a great deal because such a translation is not easy to produce, at least in English, mainly because many translators could not render it into English idiom without causing translation loss. For instance, if you visit <a href="https://quran.com/87">https://quran.com/87</a> and go to the 12th Verse, you will see these translations:</p>
<p>ٱلَّذِي يَصۡلَى ٱلنَّارَ ٱلۡكُبۡرَىٰ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he who will roast in the Gigantic Fire,<br>
— Fadel Soliman, Bridges’ translation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He who will be flung to the great Fire<br>
— English Translation (Pickthall)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who will enter the Great Fire,<br>
— English Translation (Yusuf Ali)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the one who will roast in the greatest Fire, shunts it aside;<br>
— Dr. T. B. Irving</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who will enter the great Fire (and will be made to taste its burning).<br>
— Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali &amp; Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original has &rsquo;naar-al-kobraa&rsquo; where &rsquo;naar&rsquo; means fire but &lsquo;kobraa&rsquo; is a derivative of &lsquo;kabeer&rsquo; meaning big and/or great. So, while &lsquo;kabeer&rsquo; can be translated to English, there is no equivalent English word for &lsquo;kobraa&rsquo;. All except Bridges&rsquo; translation are inaccurate: great, Great, greatest are not exact translations and some feeling is lost in translation. Bridges&rsquo; &lsquo;gigantic&rsquo; comes close although it&rsquo;s not perfect. However, the original does not mention nor imply &lsquo;roast&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Google does a slightly better version with &ldquo;who burns in the great fire&rdquo; in the first part, but the use of &lsquo;great&rsquo; is, as I mentioned, problematic. N.J Dawood&rsquo;s &lsquo;acclaimed&rsquo; translation, specifically the 1997 edition reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He shall burn in the gigantic Fire,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>N.J Dawood&rsquo;s translation somewhat problematic in that he has replaced the term <em>Allah</em> with <em>God</em> which reflects his bias (he is not Muslim). I believe no non-Muslim can properly translate the Noble Qur&rsquo;aan simply because&ndash;if they are still non-Muslim, then&ndash;they are not intelligent enough to undertake such a task: having translated the Noble Qur&rsquo;aan and still remained non-Muslim? That is lack of intelligence in my opinion, and this of course means the person is not qualified to undertake such an important task.</p>
<p>Indeed, others have found numerous issues with his biased translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He rearranged the chapters (surahs) into more-or-less chronological order in his first edition, which deviated from the traditional sequence of the Quran.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He presented the Quran as a patriarchal, sexist text, using terms such as “Men” and “Mankind” instead of “People” or &ldquo;Humanity&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He translated the word “houris” as “virgins” in verse 2:25, which gave the impression that Muslim paradise is full of carnal pleasures, contrary to the Quran’s explicit denial of such pleasures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He used an archaic, literal style that failed to capture the poetic and rhetorical features of the original Arabic text.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He distorted the Quran’s meanings or omitted some verses or phrases that he deemed irrelevant or redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please see references for the sources of these points.</p>
<p>A good translator should be a practicing Muslim, who is also a scholar in the Islamic traditions and knowledge. N.J. Dawood is none of these, so if he makes mistakes in translation, he will not know he has made those mistakes.</p>
<p>Luckily, because I had also learned classical Persian since I was a teenager, I was able to eventually find a Persian translation by Abdur-Rauf Herawi (A Sunni translation) that adds additional commentaries from the Hadith (Spoken Tradition of our Prophet SAW) providing a context for the meanings.</p>
<p>In this Persian translation, the word &lsquo;Kobraa&rsquo; is given in classical Persian &lsquo;Kobraa&rsquo; because Persian has inherited many words from Arabic and the meaning is somewhat apparent to a Persian-speaking reader, but it&rsquo;s not a word in common usage so additional comment explains the difference between a &lsquo;Soghraa&rsquo; (minor) and a &lsquo;Kobraa&rsquo; (major) fire, by which is meant that the fire of Hell is Kobraa&ndash;thus more painful and dreadful than the Soghraa (minor) fire of this world.</p>
<p>In short, most English translations of the Noble Qur&rsquo;aan fall short of the minimum standards for a good translation, even if the intentions are good in most cases; just so the gentle reader doesn&rsquo;t leave empty-handed, the next best English translation that I find acceptable-ish enough is by Dr. Khattab&rsquo;s <em>The Clear Quran</em>. This translation has been approved by al-Azhar university in Cairo.</p>
<p>May you succeed in your journey of self-purification, amen.</p>
