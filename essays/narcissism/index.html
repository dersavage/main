                <p>I was born in the latter years of the 70&rsquo;s, so when I was growing up in the 80&rsquo;s, I remember a world very different from the one in 2024, some four decades later.</p>
<p>I remember a world where as a five-year-old foreign child living in a foreign country (USSR), my mom would send me to get bread from the bakery without worrying about anything happening to me. The bakery was far enough, perhaps over a kilometer, and the snow on the roadside nearly reaching my neck.</p>
<p>Not only I didn&rsquo;t feel afraid, but I was also treated very well. The bakery lady would praise my impeccable Russian and gently give me the bread with kindness shining on her face. On the road, people would smile at me. Once, a lady roughly my mom&rsquo;s age then even gave me some snacks she had just bought! I recall all this.</p>
<p>As a digression, to show just how far I&rsquo;d walk without my parents I even tried to find my old apartment block and that very bakery and even my KG on Yandex Maps. Here&rsquo;s our apartment block (in the top left corner, the bakery in the center, and my KG on the bottom right):</p>

    <img src="https://dersavage.github.io/main/img/apartment.png"  alt="apartment"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<p>Basically I am thinking just how nice people were back in the early 80&rsquo;s. At least the people in my social space were.</p>
<p>Those good memories are a stark contrast with the feeling that a sudden increase in narcissism which has made social life full of potential difficulties is on the increase, possibly behaving like an epidemic, especially among the younger people.</p>
<p>In the last year alone, out of 18 clients I worked with, 14 turned out to be suffering from narcissistic personality disorders, leading to difficult conversations and eventual &lsquo;discard&rsquo; as is commonly practiced by them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just at work. Socially, nowadays, whereever I turn, somehow, I always end up dealing with narcissists. On the basketball court, at least half of the people I played with or against exhibitied NPD symptoms.</p>
<p>Even in virtual environments, I feel this. On Quora, where I regularly write, I used to often receive private messages from narcissists (trying to &lsquo;butter me up for supply&rsquo; until I decided to switch it off; now, roughly half of the comments made on my answers are by people suffering from severe NPD.).</p>
<p>What happened to the world?</p>
