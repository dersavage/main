      <description>This is a first post in LR category&amp;ndash;Language Review&amp;ndash;where I will factually opine on various programming languages. And today&amp;rsquo;s victim is Lisp.
Or first, let me say the emperor has no clothes, or Scheme is an awful language.
I mean, not only it is an awful first language to teach beginners, or to self-learn on your own, but also in general, as a programming language in 2023, it is not as great as it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be.</description>

      <title>Truly Object-oriented in &#39;Twin Peaks&#39;</title>

      <description>This is the first post in the CR&amp;ndash;Code Review&amp;ndash;series. I hit upon the idea after I found this interesting discussion regarding Swift playgrounds, book 2 (Let&amp;rsquo;s Code 2), chapter named &amp;lsquo;Twin Peaks&amp;rsquo; in Scrabtree&amp;rsquo;s website, where he lamented his very long solution compared to Samantha&amp;rsquo;s shorter solution.
The purpose of this CR is to bring learners&amp;rsquo; attention to an interesting thing about object orientation: objects can be interdependent even if they were instantiated independently.</description>
