<p>I often remember my very first gift. It was a book, given to me by my (maternal) grandpa. I was too young to read or even know what books were, but I felt fascinated nevertheless, and what&rsquo;s interesting to me still, is that I remember this event so vividly.</p>
<p>I was so little that I didn&rsquo;t know my name, how old I was, or even <em>what</em> I was. Like all children, I was instinctively behaving without knowing why (children develop reasoning skills after age six). All I knew was that it &lsquo;felt good&rsquo; to have a colorful book in my hand. I would leaf through the book and savor each moment with the eagerness of a maximally curious child.</p>
<p>My grandpa was my best friend, my parent figure, my role model, and extremely kind to me. He was a well-read, polyglot polymath, a man of words and war both, an authentic human being. He once told my mother: &rsquo;this boy of yours is no common boy; I&rsquo;ve seen children but not like this one. He is too intelligent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My mother would often tell me this, taking pride in my grandpa&rsquo;s assessment of me. This was the reason, I think (probably due to Pegasus effect), that I breezed through school, acing my way to graduation. Or perhaps grandpa <em>was</em> right. Perhaps I <em>was</em> special. It&rsquo;s hard to be objective about ourselves&hellip;</p>
<p>I am a neuro-divergent person, a left-handed empath, an &ldquo;ADHD&rdquo;, and a friend of animals. Consequently, if anyone is cruel to animals, it&rsquo;s over between us&ndash;that person will never be my friend, nor will I consider them with anything but the deepest disdain.</p>
<p>This means, based on the definitions suggested by the Gestalt school, I am an authentic person. I have my likes, my dislikes, and I am very certain about my choices (they have not been chosen for me.).</p>
<p>And this site is a sort of documentation to some ideas incubating in my mind. There are ideas here spanning programming, philosophy, Islam, mathematics, art, literature, cooking, animals, poetry, films, essays and more.</p>
<h2 id="about-2023-version">About (2023 version)</h2>
<p>This is my digital cave. I will update this section when the right thoughts present themselves.</p>
<h2 id="about-2022-version">About (2022 version)</h2>
<p>Beyond childhood, youth, and the associated tribulations, I divide my life so far into three periods. The golden period, the dreamy period, and the period of reality.</p>
<p>In the golden period, which lasted nearly 15 years, I was a professor of mathematics, social and natural sciences at several universities in East Asia.</p>
<p>In the dreamy period, I stopped teaching and entered the land of programming. The teacher and the programmer are still a part of me, even though I have entered the stage of reality. In this stage, I strive to have the color of colorlessness.</p>
<p>I write so I can think better.</p>
