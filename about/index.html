<h2 id="about-2022-version">About (2022 version)</h2>
<p>This is my digital cave. Here, under posts, you will find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ES: Essay
Posts labeled ES are essays that do not fall into the &lsquo;review&rsquo; type of writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BR: Book reviews
When I read a book, I will write a reaction essay either lambasting or praising it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LR: Language reviews
Programmers are emotional creatures. We like some languages, others we don&rsquo;t. Here I will compare languages and opinionate on how different languages impress (or depress) me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MR: Movie reviews
Some movies need to be reviewed. I will exercise rhetorical skills and lingustic acrobatics mainly, but in the context of either praising or attacking a movie that has earned it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CR: Code reviews
Especially for those who are learning programming, or are junior developers. Here I will sort of &rsquo;teach&rsquo; by way of reviewing others&rsquo; code. I will also present my recommendations and ways of doing the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SR: Serial reviews
Again, like movie reviews but applied to TV series.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AR: Author reviews
Here I will not be discussing a specific book but a specific author, which means tackling <em>all</em> of their books in one post. This saves time, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under <code>My Books</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will find all the books I have written. These will redirect to my online bookstore. If you have come from my Quora page looking to get my books, this is the right place to go to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under <code>to Julia</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will find a quick, no fluff, extremely-beginner-friendly-but-not-pathetically-condescending anti-pedantic introduction to the most basic foundation of programming, complete with exercises and solutions. No pre-requisites assumed.</p>
<p>I have have offered this as a potential solution to those gentle readers who might be needing the required background for one of my books. If you are interesting in programming, this is as gentle and useful an introduction as you can ever get. The language I chose is Julia because it&rsquo;s elegant without being difficult.</p>
<p>This tutorial goes from switching your computer on and variable assignment all the way to booleans, logicals, functions, and conditionals (including ternary). No loops are covered (that would be in the book!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under <code>to Ruby</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar tutorial is offered at a slightly higher level of difficulty. It is the logical next thing to read after <code>to Julia</code>. Although the language has changed, they are similar enough to not present any problems. It also provides a chance to appreciate the minimal differences across programming languages.</p>
<p>This chapter covers object-oriented programming at its most basic level, starting with objects and classes and staying within this context because many texts gloss over this and move on to other topics while students are still shaky in the foundations. This foundation provides enough exercise and mental stimulus to enable the learner to appreciate what objects and classes are, and how they are used together.</p>
<h2 id="about-2021-version">About (2021 version)</h2>
<p>Beyond childhood, youth, and the associated tribulations, I divide my life so far into three periods. The golden period, the dreamy period, and the period of reality.</p>
<p>In the golden period, which lasted nearly 15 years, I was a professor of mathematics, social and natural sciences at several universities in East Asia.</p>
<p>In the dreamy period, I stopped teaching and entered the land of programming. The teacher and the programmer are still a part of me, even though I have entered the stage of reality. In this stage, I strive to have the color of colorlessness.</p>
<p>I write so I can think better.</p>
