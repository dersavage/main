                <p>I finally got round to watching Eight Below Zero. And I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
<p>This here is a movie unlike much of the recent garbage coming out of Hollywood. For starters, there is no profanity and no obscenities; the female lead is decently dressed, and there is no anti-religious agenda pushed through the movie. The movie is artless and pure, like the the huskies featuring in it.</p>
<p>Paul Walker (rest in peace, brother) brings his superb and realistic acting skills to the screen and it is clear that Walker is a dog-person and his affection for the huskies is real and unpretentious. Although he&rsquo;s acting, the feelings he is showing for his dog friends is real.</p>
<p>The movie is more about dogs than humans, but it also caters to the dog-owners&rsquo; love for dogs. Walker&rsquo;s relentless drive to save the dogs he promised to save is very similar to the feelings I&rsquo;ve had when I had to save XH and 77 in a village, in 2021.</p>
<p>Very good movie, and quite realistic.</p>
