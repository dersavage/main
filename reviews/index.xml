      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆f: Herbert&#39;s Dune</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/dune/</link>

      <description>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s over.
But was it worth it? And why did I put up with it?
On Amazon, Dune has 99000 or so reviews, 97% of them five-star. I had to read this stupid book just in the interest of science, to see whether I should trust a large number of positive reviews in 2024.
It turns out, my poor opinion of this book is also, indirectly, an indictment of the intellects of those people who found the book worth five stars.</description>

      <title>☆★★★★★★★★★: Gogol&#39;s Diary of a Madman</title>

      <description>Before reading a translated work, I often find as many translations as I can in order to choose the best. To me, the best means close to the original in both how words must have sounded in the original, but also rendering it in English in such a way that it should, by itself, have its own literary merits in English.
Translations of foreign novels rare rarely loyal but everytime I find a good translation, it confirms my hunch that the translator must be a writer and an artist of a high caliber.</description>

      <title>★★★★★★★★★★: FILM: Eight Below Zero</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/eight_below/</link>

      <description>I finally got round to watching Eight Below Zero. And I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did.
This here is a movie unlike much of the recent garbage coming out of Hollywood. For starters, there is no profanity and no obscenities; the female lead is decently dressed, and there is no anti-religious agenda pushed through the movie. The movie is artless and pure, like the the huskies featuring in it.
Paul Walker (rest in peace, brother) brings his superb and realistic acting skills to the screen and it is clear that Walker is a dog-person and his affection for the huskies is real and unpretentious.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆: Tears of joke: marginal functionalism</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the_infinite_joke/</link>

      <description>Did you understand the title of this essay? Probably not. Neither would I have understood, to be frank, were I not the author. That&amp;rsquo;s because when I was coming up with a title for this essay, which, in my mind, arose as an allergic reaction to the garbage that David Foster Wallace&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;The Infinite Jest&amp;rdquo; is, I was sort of trying to convey the idea that I was going to write an essay about the fact that some people among us are merely marginally functional&amp;ndash;functional enough to be considered legally sane&amp;ndash;but otherwise are actually seriously mentally ill, and that, this was a joke that was going to cause tears, not laughter.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆★★★★★★★: Maugham&#39;s A Friend in Need</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/maugham/</link>

      <description>Everytime I picked Somerset Maugham&amp;rsquo;s books, two thoughts simultaneously would occur to me: the books were heavy and thick, and the print was too small. Consequently, I kept thinking, maybe when I find a better print, or when I have time.
A few days ago and quite accidentally, I ran into one of his short stories &amp;ldquo;A Friend in Need&amp;rdquo;. Now, normally, were I a somewhat-educated person, I would not have understood it.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆★★★★★★★: Matsumoto&#39;s Ruby Book</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the_ruby_book/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 17:45:19 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the_ruby_book/</guid>
      <description>There are not many good technical books, but Matsumoto&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Ruby Programming Language&amp;rdquo;, co-authored with Flanagan, stands out as one of best examples of technical writing.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
The writing is succinct without being abstrusely terse. It&amp;rsquo;s clear without being simplistic. The sentences are fluff-free and the meanings are conveyed clearly, like a good Ruby program. Consider this excerpt for example from page 75:
Every object has a well-defined class in Ruby, and that class never changes during the lifetime of the object.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆: Larsson&#39;s The Girl With...</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the-girl-with-the/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 21:05:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the-girl-with-the/</guid>
      <description>As it is, Larsson&amp;rsquo;s The girl with the dragon tattoo has nearly 31000 reviews, 68% of them five-star. This book crossed paths with me on and off several times since 2010, but my instinctual response would always be: &amp;lsquo;ahhh? no.&amp;rsquo;.
IN 2023, however, I had no other books to read in the toilet, so I decided to settle the matter once and for all. If it&amp;rsquo;s such a super-thriller people kept raving about, then there was going to be only one way to find out.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆★★★: Tolkien&#39;s Hobbit</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/the-hobbit/</link>

      <description>I think what most people who don&amp;rsquo;t read don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that reading is a more active process than watching movie because your own imagination creates &amp;ldquo;scenes&amp;rdquo; in the deep-end of the mind.
This is exactly why, at least for me, watching the movie then reading the book, is akin to ruining the reading experience.
And with an exception or two, the books are always way, way better than the movies based on them.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆★: FILM: Inception</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/inception-/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 12:47:35 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>In this essay, I am going to rant about Inception.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t think I watched it. I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to go beyond 17 minutes (out of 2+ hours). I think 17 minutes is enough to decide whether it is rubbish or not. In my opinion, it is a rubbish of the most interesting sort.
But how can it be? Out of 16000 reviews on Amazon, 95% are five- and four-star.</description>

      <title>☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆: Ayn Rand&#39;s every book</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/ayn-rand/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 22:48:07 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/ayn-rand/</guid>
      <description>Today, the victim of my incisive criticism is Ayn Rand (or more accurtately, Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum). Now, a discerning thinker might object: but how can you criticize someone you haven&amp;rsquo;t read? Our answer is: do we need to befriend someone whose manners in the first few minutes of our acquaintance repulsed us? Time is gold, so a few paragraphs illustrating her thoughts would provide enough ammunition for a full-scale rubbishing.</description>
