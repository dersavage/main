            <div class="post-content">
                <p>As it is, Larsson&rsquo;s <em>The girl with the dragon tattoo</em> has nearly 31000 reviews, 68% of them five-star. This book crossed paths with me on and off several times since 2010, but my instinctual response would always be: &lsquo;ahhh? no.&rsquo;.</p>
<p>IN 2023, however, I had no other books to read in the toilet, so I decided to settle the matter once and for all. If it&rsquo;s such a super-thriller people kept raving about, then there was going to be only one way to find out.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is how can so many readers be so stupid as to not realize the book is utter garbage. Worse, besides not doing its required duty (being a well-written thriller novel) it&rsquo;s filled with subtle agenda points, agendas that Larsson himself espouses. For instance, he is casually flouting the idea of &lsquo;open marriage&rsquo; which is a moronic oxymoron.</p>
<p>All I wanted was a thriller, but instead, for my time and effort, I got shoddy writing, an appalling plot, too much noise, and the worst detective writing I&rsquo;ve ever read. Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t read beyond the first two chapters&ndash;as I began to realize the rest of the 600 pages will be more of the same stupid writing.</p>
<p>The one-star reviews on Amazon echo my sentiments well, so I will not rant too much, but in closing, I want to say: I was intrigued by the book after I found out the author died shortly after writing these books (which somehow suggested the books were responsible for his death). I thought, well, the guy died writing them, so let&rsquo;s see what it&rsquo;s all about; only to discover that the books have nothing to do with his death.</p>
<p>In short, the books were most probably rejected by publishers and his explains why they weren&rsquo;t published when he was alive. As to why someone tried to publish and hype them so much? Maybe it was part of a social experiment?</p>
<p>In any case, I won&rsquo;t be reading any modern Swedish authors again. Life is short.</p>
