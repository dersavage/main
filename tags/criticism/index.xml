      <description>In this AR (author review) series, of which this is a first post, I will be reviewing authors. My goal in this is two-fold: to convince myself that I have saved time not reading an author because of the inferior quality of their thoughts; and also, to engage in a debate of sorts with that author for the benefit of the good reader.
Today, the victim of my incisive criticism is Ayn Rand (or more accurtately, Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum).</description>
