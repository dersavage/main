      <description>﷽
Introduction
This is the second book in the series of programming books authored by me, Jan Savage. This book teaches both intermediate programming and intermediate Ruby: no ruby background is assumed, though. A typical learner would be someone who has finished programming 101 in any language (say, Chris Pine&amp;rsquo;s Learn to Program because it uses Ruby), or learned some programming here and there&amp;ndash;Youtube?&amp;ndash;but now wants to consolidate their gains and go to the next level.</description>

      <title>Hello Julia?</title>

      <description>﷽
Introduction
This is the first and free chapter of my upcoming programming in Julia textbook. The digital-only book assumes no pre-requisites, but moves at a rather fast pace (no fluff, no stories about author), all the while avoiding any irrational jumps, the confusing jargon overload, or the boring handwaving so typical in many programming books.
If you already have basic programming experience and want to go to the next level, please proceed to Ruby (see above)where the lessons are start at the advanced beginner and go all the way to the intermediate level.</description>

      <description>﷽
Beyond childhood, youth, and the associated tribulations, I divide my life so far into three periods. The golden period, the dreamy period, and the period of reality.
In the golden period, which lasted nearly 15 years, I was a professor of mathematics, social and natural sciences at several universities in East Asia.
In the dreamy period, I stopped teaching and entered the land of programming. The teacher and the programmer are still a part of me, even though I have entered the stage of reality.</description>
