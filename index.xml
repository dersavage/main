      <title>A To-Do app in Vlang</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/tutorials/todo-app-in-vlang/</link>

      <description>V language, also known as Vlang promises C&amp;rsquo;s speed, Rust&amp;rsquo;s safety, Go&amp;rsquo;s syntax. However, there is only one Vlang book avaiable from Packt and even that is simply listing language features&amp;ndash;a mere simpler documentation.
In this tutorial, I provide a real-world practical example: a command-line to-do app.
Audience:
Students and enthusiasts who have learned some programming but don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do next. They taught you to draw shapes, now draw the owl!</description>

      <title>Interactive Python VSCode/Mac?</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/tutorials/python-on-vscode/</link>

      <description>Legend Potential Audience:
Learners wanting to use a free but industrial-grade Python IDE on a Mac. Anyone having trouble using Python on Visual Studio Code because it &amp;lsquo;won&amp;rsquo;t run&amp;rsquo;. Why Mac? Unless you are Jabba, the Meister Programmer, I advise all learners to use MacOS for the smoothest possible journey in their quest to become programmers.
That&amp;rsquo;s because at its heart, MacOS is simply a flavor of Unix and you can&amp;rsquo;t do serious programming on Windows&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s a fact acknowledged by Microsoft, too (hence their providing the WSL).</description>

      <title>The Hobbit</title>

      <description>I think what most people who don&amp;rsquo;t read don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that reading is a more active process than watching movie because your own imagination creates &amp;ldquo;scenes&amp;rdquo; in the deep-end of the mind.
This is exactly why, at least for me, watching the movie then reading the book, is akin to ruining the reading experience.
And with an exception or two, the books are always way, way better than the movies based on them.</description>

      <title>The Noble Qur&#39;aan&#39;s Translations</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/essays/noble-quran-translations/</link>

      <description>I learned Qur&amp;rsquo;aanic Arabic (as a foreign language&amp;ndash;at the local mosque) when I was eight years old. But then decades had to pass when, after learning a great deal of worldly things, I am now feeling ready to truly study our Noble Book, and while I am brushing up on my classical Arabic, in the meantime, I wanted to find an English translation that was not deviating from the original in any sense.</description>

      <title>Why Lisp is horrible</title>

      <description>This is a first post in LR category&amp;ndash;Language Review&amp;ndash;where I will factually opine on various programming languages. And today&amp;rsquo;s victim is Lisp.
Or first, let me say the emperor has no clothes, or Scheme is an awful language.
I mean, not only it is an awful first language to teach beginners, or to self-learn on your own, but also in general, as a programming language in 2023, it is not as great as it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be.</description>

      <title>Truly Object-oriented in &#39;Twin Peaks&#39;</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/tutorials/oop-in-swift-grounds/</link>

      <description>This is the first post in the CR&amp;ndash;Code Review&amp;ndash;series. I hit upon the idea after I found this interesting discussion regarding Swift playgrounds, book 2 (Let&amp;rsquo;s Code 2), chapter named &amp;lsquo;Twin Peaks&amp;rsquo; in Scrabtree&amp;rsquo;s website, where he lamented his very long solution compared to Samantha&amp;rsquo;s shorter solution.
The purpose of this CR is to bring learners&amp;rsquo; attention to an interesting thing about object orientation: objects can be interdependent even if they were instantiated independently.</description>

      <title>Inception: What on earth?</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/essays/inception-/</link>

      <description>In this essay, I am going to rant about Inception.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t think I watched it. I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to go beyond 17 minutes (out of 2+ hours). I think 17 minutes is enough to decide whether it is rubbish or not. In my opinion, it is a rubbish of the most interesting sort.
But how can it be? Out of 16000 reviews on Amazon, 95% are five- and four-star.</description>

      <title>Rubbishing Ayn Rand</title>
      <link>https://dersavage.github.io/main/reviews/ayn-rand/</link>

      <description>Today, the victim of my incisive criticism is Ayn Rand (or more accurtately, Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum). Now, a discerning thinker might object: but how can you criticize someone you haven&amp;rsquo;t read? Our answer is: do we need to befriend someone whose manners in the first few minutes of our acquaintance repulsed us? Time is gold, so a few paragraphs illustrating her thoughts would provide enough ammunition for a full-scale rubbishing.</description>

      <title>Middlemarch</title>

      <description>Middlemarch by
George Eliot A book that was lauded (by Woolf) as the only British novel written for grownups. I dislike Woolf and I am not even sure why. There&amp;rsquo;s something off-putting in how her name, in combination with titles of some of her works, is perceived by me.
But I also disliked &amp;ldquo;George Eliot&amp;rdquo; without knowing exactly why. That was a long time ago, well before I knew it was a &amp;lsquo;she&amp;rsquo; and not a &amp;lsquo;he&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;ldquo;George Eliot&amp;rdquo; was a pseudonym.</description>

      <title>Where Evil Resides</title>

      <description>Where Evil Resides by
Clifford Simak (BR: Book Review)
Recently managed to go through Simak&amp;rsquo;s fantasy title: Where Evil Resides, which made me wonder why a writer like Simak became famous in the first place? But again I see morons like Updike and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me: not all readers are intelligent enough to know what they should be reading.
Simak is nothing special. The story is flat, the characteras uni-dimensional.</description>
