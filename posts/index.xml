            <description>Darker than Amber John Macdonald Don&amp;rsquo;t know what the fuss is all about. I read the reviews which were glowing, but the book didn&amp;rsquo;t deliver on those reviews.
The problem is that MacDonald is confused. He mixes his own conflated view of morality in the context of a poorly-constructed detective story, and the outcome is mangled mess of opinion and long, boring descriptions of rooms and furniture, with a few sleaze quirks thrown here and there.</description>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know what the fuss is all about. I read the reviews which were glowing, but the book didn&rsquo;t deliver on those reviews.</p>
<p>The problem is that MacDonald is confused. He mixes his own conflated view of morality in the context of a poorly-constructed detective story, and the outcome is mangled mess of opinion and long, boring descriptions of rooms and furniture, with a few sleaze quirks thrown here and there.</p>
<p>The story almost borders on fantastical, and feels like a bad mix of Hollywood on steroids and a happier, weirder Trollope.</p>
<p>Not recommended.</p>
