            <description>Where Evil Resides by
Clifford Simak (BR: Book Review)
Recently managed to go through Simak&amp;rsquo;s fantasy title: Where Evil Resides, which made me wonder why a writer like Simak became famous in the first place? But again I see morons like Updike and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me: not all readers are intelligent enough to know what they should be reading.
Simak is nothing special. The story is flat, the characteras uni-dimensional.</description>

<p>Recently managed to go through Simak&rsquo;s fantasy title: <em>Where Evil Resides</em>, which made me wonder why a writer like Simak became famous in the first place? But again I see morons like Updike and it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me: not all readers are intelligent enough to know what they should be reading.</p>
<p>Simak is nothing special. The story is flat, the characteras uni-dimensional. The allegorical context-play is shoddy and confusing, and it seems he winged it as he wrote along.</p>
<p>One finds it hard to develop sympathy for any of the characters, and the the way the main protagonist treats the troll is heart-breaking and probably a psychological projection of the author&rsquo;s own Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p>There is nothing to learn and the entertainment was not entertaining at all. I won&rsquo;t be reading any more Simak books.</p>

            <description>Darker than Amber John Macdonald (BR: Book Review)
Don&amp;rsquo;t know what the fuss is all about. I read the reviews which were glowing, but the book didn&amp;rsquo;t deliver on those reviews.
The problem is that MacDonald is confused. He mixes his own conflated view of morality in the context of a poorly-constructed detective story, and the outcome is mangled mess of opinion and long, boring descriptions of rooms and furniture, with a few sleaze quirks thrown here and there.</description>

<p>The story almost borders on fantastical, and feels like a bad mix of Hollywood on steroids and a happier, weirder Trollope.</p>
<p>Not recommended.</p>
